The Directorate of Technical Education initiated rapid development and expansion works of degree, diploma and trade level technical education in the country. To cope up with increasing magnitude of academic activities, the need for establishment of a &#8220;Statutory Board&#8221; was keenly felt. A statutory body namely &#8220;The East Pakistan Technical Education Board&#8221; was established through Act. No. 1 of 1967 of the then East Pakistan Assembly, which is how Bangladesh Technical Education Board (BTEB). Thus the Bangladesh Technical Education Board came into existence with the jurisdiction over the entire area of Bangladesh to organize, supervise, regulate, control and develop technical and vocational education. The Board in its present form became operative with effect from June 1969.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #33cccc;\">Admission going on: please collect admission form our permanent campus at Uttara.<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Name of Course: Air Hostess \/ Cabin crew- short course<\/li>\n<li>Minimum Requirement:<\/li>\n<li>SSC\/O-Level Minimum<\/li>\n<li>Course Duration: 3 Months<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #33cccc;\">The Cabin Crew Diploma course consists of 18 separate modules with a test at the end of each module.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The modules on the cabin crew course contain information on what you will be typically expected to learn on joining an airline for the position of cabin crew.
